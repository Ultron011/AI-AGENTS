## Literature Review: No-Code Tools for Building Multi-Agent AI Systems

### Introduction

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an increasing demand for the development of multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Traditionally, building such systems required extensive coding knowledge and development time, which created barriers for non-technical users. The advent of no-code tools has transformed this landscape, allowing users without programming skills to design and implement multi-agent AI systems. This literature review explores the recent advancements in no-code platforms tailored for MAS, highlighting their capabilities, methodologies, and future directions.

### Overview of No-Code Tools

No-code tools for AI agent development offer user-friendly interfaces and abstract the complexities of coding. According to a blog post by Kore.ai (2023), no-code agent builders enable teams to translate business needs into working agent logic while enabling visual composition of workflows, effectively lowering the barrier to entry for AI development (Kore.ai, 2023). Similarly, Budibase (2023) defines no-code AI agent builders as platforms that facilitate the creation and management of agents without traditional coding, often through drag-and-drop interfaces (Budibase, 2023).

Lindy’s no-code AI agent builder, praised for its usability, includes features like ready-to-use templates and the capacity to create multi-agent workflows. It allows agents to collaborate, sharing tasks or communicating asynchronously, which is essential for MAS (Lindy, 2023).

### Multi-Agent Coordination and Collaboration

An essential aspect of building effective MAS is the ability for agents to communicate and collaborate. In the survey by Zhu et al. (2022), the effectiveness of communication within multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) contexts is highlighted. The authors identify several communication modalities that enhance coordination among agents, potentially informing how no-code tools might incorporate these features to enhance user-created agent collaboration (Zhu et al., 2022).

Moreover, recent developments in context engineering for multi-agent code assistants demonstrate the integration of LLMs (Large Language Models) with no-code tools. Haseeb (2025) explores a workflow that incorporates an Intent Translator and contexts managed through various AI tools, showcasing improved interaction and collaboration among agents in code generation tasks (Haseeb, 2025).

### Methodologies for Building Multi-Agent Systems

The methodologies adopted in no-code platforms often draw from established frameworks in agent-based modeling. The work of Soyez et al. (2013) discusses an innovative methodology for multi-level system simulations incorporating agent dynamics, which could inform the design principles of no-code tools aimed at fostering MAS (Soyez et al., 2013).

In addition, the use of conventions in augmenting action spaces has been explored by Bredell et al. (2024), suggesting how no-code tools can innovate cooperation mechanisms among agents using implicit knowledge sharing strategies (Bredell et al., 2024).

### Tools and Frameworks Supporting No-Code Development

Several no-code platforms have emerged to provide robust support for MAS. Some notable frameworks include AgentSpotter, which offers profiling tools specifically designed for agent-oriented programming, focusing on improving system performance and communication (Doan Van Bien et al., 2015). This highlights a crucial area where no-code tools can provide insights into system behavior and optimization for user-created agent systems.

MindStudio is another promising platform that utilizes a low-code/no-code framework to facilitate the deployment of AI agents tailored to business needs, demonstrating its potential for realizing practical solutions within a familiar interface (MindStudio, 2023).

### Conclusion

No-code tools for building multi-agent AI systems are redefining the traditional paradigms of AI development. By democratizing access to complex system design, they empower a broader range of users to engage in AI development. Future research should focus on enhancing the collaborative capabilities of these tools and integrating advanced communication features to fortify MAS. The continuous evolution of these platforms will likely yield innovative methodologies that can adapt to the growing complexities in AI applications.
