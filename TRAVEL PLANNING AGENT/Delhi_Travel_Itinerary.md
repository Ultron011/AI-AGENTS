## Additional Tips:

- **Weather**: Check the weather forecasts beforehand as Delhi can get quite hot during summer months. Wear comfortable shoes for walking.
- **Safety**: Like any large city, be mindful of your belongings and surroundings, especially in crowded places.

## Language and Communication Tips:
1. **Language Basics**: While English is widely spoken in Delhi, especially in tourist areas and by younger people, it's helpful to know a few basic Hindi phrases. Simple words like "Namaste" (Hello), "Dhanyavaad" (Thank you), and "Kitne ka hai?" (How much is this?) can be useful.

2. **Mobile Apps**: Use translation apps like Google Translate, which can help you with Hindi translations on the go. It can be particularly handy in markets or local eateries where English might not be as commonly spoken.

3. **Transportation Communication**: When using app-based cabs like Uber or Ola, ensure that the destination is clearly marked on the app. If you're using auto-rickshaws, it's good to know the name or a landmark near your destination in Hindi, just in case.

4. **Printed Materials**: Carry a guidebook or a printout of your itinerary in case mobile networks are spotty, which can sometimes happen in older parts of the city.

5. **Hotel Concierges**: If you have specific language concerns or require assistance, consider asking for help from your hotel concierge, who can often make arrangements or provide advice in English.

Enjoy your adventure in Delhi!
